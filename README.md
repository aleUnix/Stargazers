# Stargazers
Github Stargazers

Swift mobile app through the GitHub API, allows you to view the list of stargazers in a repository (the list of users who have added it to their favorites). The app must allow the user to type the owner and name of the repository and must therefore show the list (including avatar and username) of the users who have added it to their favorites.
